thingie to auto-boilerplate shell scripts

yes its useless

TODO maybe write better text here

TODO maybe write better code

make warcrime to just compile and

make install to automagically put it into a directory that ought to be in your path

usage:

echo $( shebanging ) > script.sh

or

cat << EOF > script.sh
$( shebanging )
EOF

you'll figure it out.
